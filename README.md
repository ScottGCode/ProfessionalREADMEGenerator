# Professional README Generator

## Description

As a developer I wanted to create a README generator so I can spend more time working on my code. I wanted to be able to create a professional README quickly and easily without having to make one from scratch for each project. I was able to achieve this using node inquirer 8.2.4 and prompts in a command line application that gathers data from user input and then dynamically generates a professional README.md file. This allows any project creator to devote more time to working on the project instead of spending time creating a README. While creating this application I learned how to work with the node inquirer package to dynamically generate files from user input using the command line. 


## Installation

To install this project and get the development enviroment up and running:

1. Fork and clone the code from the repository provided in the GitHub link. 
2. Open index.js in the integrated terminal.
3. Run ```npm install inquirer@8.2.4``` to install the dependencies.

## Usage

To use this command line application first open the file in the integrated terminal. Run the command ```node index.js``` and answer all the prompts that follow. Once you are finished you will recieve a "Success" message and your README.md will be generated. Your README will be stored a folder named utils and will be titled ```generatedREADME.md```. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
